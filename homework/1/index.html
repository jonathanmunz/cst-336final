                Hello!   <br />
                <p>Thank you for visiting my Introduction to Networking website. </p>
                
                <p>This website is designed to introduce you to the basics of computer networking. </p>
                
                <p> What is computer networking? </p> 
                  
                <p>Computer Networking is connecting many differant computers together so that they can talk to eachother, this is how the internet functions. There are many differant topics in computer networking. This website will start with the basics of computer networking, then further discuss three other important networking topics; Routing, NAT, and ACLs. So first let's start by discussing how computers on the same network talk to eachother. Computers which are connected to eachother with an ethernet cable are considered to be on the same LAN. We can connect multiple computers together using a device called a switch. A switch has a lot of ports and interconnects multiple computers. Computers connected together with a switch are also on the same LAN. These devices have a unique address called the MAC address. This address is a physical address which is on every networking device. If two devices want to comminicate, they send a message to another devices MAC address.If a device wants to communicate with another device on a differant LAN, it sends it's message to the router. </p>
