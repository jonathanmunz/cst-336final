                <p>What is an ACL?. </p>
                
                <p>An ACL is used to control the flow of traffic on a network. There are two types of ACLs; Standard and Extended. Standard ACLs permit or deny traffic based on the IP address. Extended ACLs use several additional parameters such as traffic type. ACLs are placed on a router interface and can be applied in either the inbound or outbound direction. The ACL will then permit or deny traffic going in and out of the router interface based on the source IP address. These are just some basic topics of networking, and they arent neccesarily taught in the order which I presented them. I just picked a few of my favorite topics. If you found any of this interesting I highly recommend taking an introductory class! </p>
