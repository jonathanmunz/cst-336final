                Routing <br />
                <p>What is routing? </p>
                
                <p>Routing refers to sending information from one computer network to another. </p>
                
                <p>It is called routing because the way that computers send information from one network to another is by using the router. Routers seperate computer networks, so if you want to send a message to someone on a differant computer network, then you must use a router. When a computer wants to send a message, it uses the IP address and the subnet mask to determine if the destination address is on the same network. If it is on the same network it sends the message to the computer, if not, it sends the message to the router. When the router receives the message it looks at it's routing table to decide where to send the message.  </p>
